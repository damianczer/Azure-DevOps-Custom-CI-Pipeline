Script optimizes **CI/CD** and improves software delivery performance. **MsBuild** accepts as input a soluition file, which can contain up to hundreds of projects, this means that every attempt to deliver a software package to some host has to end with building the entire solution? <br>

Even if I have a small change in one project?
<br>

Well, no!<br>

The script detects what changes have occurred compared to the indicated branch, example: we are working on a **feature branch** - then we create a **pull request to the develop** and **from the develop we push(build)** the package to the server. So, the develop will compare to the **master** and build selected projects from the solution - those that need rebuilding. As it turns out, it speeds up the work a lot. <br>

This solution has its conditions - **the main application may be in legacy projects where CI/CD does not work according to the art and there is no budget for its configuration**.

Is just an example of a solution - it can be customized for the specifics of the project.

Do you have a **BIG** solution? <br />
More than **100** projects? <br />
Don't you use **Docker Containers** or **CI/CD** and have to build the whole solution? <br />
Does it take a lot of time to build the entire solution through **Pipeline Azure DevOps**? <br />
Are you waiting more than **20 minutes** even the changes were minimal? <br />

Here is the Solution! <br />

MSBuild Configuration:

Call **MSBuild** inside **Build.proj** with our global variable (list of changed projects) instead of Solution File (.sln):

If your deployment method allows you to _"copy only changed files/projects/.dlls"_ -> **let's do it!** Don't build the whole soloution, build what has changed! If the projects are dependent on each other - references will be built! This is just a proposal for a solution/optimization of software delivery to the client server.

Enjoy!
